From that time until now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My stuff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time.

The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650$ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to stuff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000$.

The flight was scheduled to leave at 8:36 PM and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. It was supposed to be a simple flight that I had made many times before. The morning of the flight, I checked the flight status and it said it was delayed to depart FLL at 11:10 PM and arrive at JFK at 2:07 AM. This was a big problem because I had a connecting international flight from another airline that was scheduled to leave JFK on-time at 2:30 AM. I was shocked and Jetblue website did not explain why it was delayed. I figured I would go to the airport early so I could get on another flight to NYC. After I arrived and waited in line for customer service, I talked to a Jetblue representative about the situation.He said he could get me and my family on another flight leaving to JFK at 8:30 PM that was delayed from 2:00 PM that afternoon. He claimed there were seats on it. However, he began to go on his phone for 20 minutes. Then, he seemed to make a call but never actually said a word. This continued for nearly 50 minutes because he finally broke the news to us that this flight was completely sold out and the next available flight was next morning. I don\u2019t know when this flight was sold out or if it was sold out when he told us there were seats on it. I don\u2019t know what he was doing on his phone for over an hour but I was frustrated as I could\u2019ve gone to another airline to buy another ticket.However, it was too late and all flights to JFK that would have allowed me to catch my connecting flight were gone because I had wasted my time with Jetblue customer service which ended up doing nothing for me. I asked the representative why flights were being delayed and he said there were thunderstorms in NYC. I checked the departure screens afterwards and it seemed that only Jetblue flights were delayed. No other airlines were delayed. I also called my family in NYC and they said there was no inclement weather the entire day. I started to question Jetblue\u2019s honesty and transparency. With no other choice, I had to go along with my original flight and figure out the situation when I arrived to JFK.At around 11 PM, the gate agent for Jetblue announced that the flight was going to be delayed for 30 more minutes because of weather. After 20 more minutes, he announced that the flight was going to be delayed until 12 AM because there was no pilot for the plane. Everyone waiting was frustrated. Finally, at a little over midnight, we were allowed to board the plane. Before taxing out, the pilot actually walked out to the aisle and said to us that he didn\u2019t even know he was supposed to be working and that he was at home watching TV when he got a call. Does Jetblue not organize or plan which flights have pilots? Or do they just get a random pilot last minute before the flight was going to leave? I was shocked at his announcement.When we finally go to JFK at 2:45 AM, my connecting flight had already left. I talked to the customer service of that airline and they said they were able to rebook me on a different flight that left that afternoon if I was able to obtain confirmation of the delayed flight from Jetblue so it was determined it was something out of my control. So I waited at the customer service for Jetblue at JFK for them to open and was able to talk to another representative. I explained the situation and she said that she was unable to give me any confirmation of any sort of how my flight to JFK from FLL was delayed. I explained to her that it was requested from a different airline and she outright said they were lying because that is a ridiculous thing to ask.I was lost at words because it seemed as if the staff only chooses what to believe if it was convenient for them. Moments later, an employee who I assumed was the supervisor came out and told me to vacate the premises because I was causing a disruption. I never raised my voice and was being polite the entire time! He claimed I was making things up and there was nothing else he could do for me. I had to go back to the other airline and tell them what had happened.Their customer service ended up calling the Jetblue customer service and regarding the delayed flight. However, they were able to sort it out and get me on the next flight out of JFK to my next destination. The amount of unprofessionalism, dishonesty, disregard for customers, and downright rudeness I have experienced from Jetblue in less than 12 hours was insane.

By now the weather in both cities was perfectly clear so we don't know why the flight was canceled. They offloaded our luggage without telling us where so my husband had to go hunting for it. It took more than an hour. The one customer service person at the luggage carousel didn't seem to know anything.

In FLL the terminal where Jetblue operates is far away from the rental cars parking, comparing to United, that operates in the same terminal. And even if Jetblue tails and admits it, you can't get anything - no business lounge, no paid hotels, absolutely nothing. I came to terminal and printed the boarding passes one hour prior to the takeoff. But the infrastructure in the airport, that works for Jetblue, is so awfully bad that I missed the flight.The system doesn't print tags for luggage and nobody assist passengers. Finally after few attempts we came to the service desk to print them, it was 50 minutes prior to takeoff. Then we spent over 20 minutes printing the tags, it's easy to see the timestamps on the tags. Finally they didn't give us all our tags, one was missing! People were extremely slow, there was a glitch in a software, then printer didn't work. Finally 25 minutes prior to takeoff we came to the security check, where we supposed to have a separate line. We didn't get it even after we told that we're missing the flight. The gate was closed strictly on time and we had to go to the Jetblue service desk.People at the desk saw right from the beginning all our statuses in the system and agreed that the was no our fault in this situation. They were not able to offer anything earlier than in 24 hours, but helped to identify all our luggage tags numbers and initiated the refund (appreciate it, however, I haven't got it so far).

We were waiting for him for 40 minutes, family of five people including five year old child, that already supposed to be sleeping on the plane. He told us that he's sorry about what happened but didn't offer anything to compensate our losses (time and money for the tickets that we had to buy in a last minute and hotel). He didn't say anything regarding the enormous timeslots for the typical operations, that we saw.His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate, one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier.

Logistical failures that prevent schedules, lack of coordination between personnel lines at airports, lousy customer service, web page with slow and outdated information, even slower app and digital tickets do not work, and again customer service goes from bad to unacceptable level of business in USA. All this painful and unpleasant experience began when, on May 9 (1 month in advance), we decided to give Jetblue a chance and bought air tickets from my family (5 members) to travel from Atlanta to Quito on June 8, returning on the 26th. We live in Alabama, which involves a 2.5 hour trip to get to the ATL airport.On June 8, we arrived at the ATL airport and checked in at the self-service kiosk and were only provided with the tags for ATL-FLL, missing the FLL-UIO route. I decided to have the customer service staff. We are not given the tags explaining that the flight is delayed. Tickets printed and everything ready, unfortunately Jetblue decided not to take off until 3.5 hours later. After 3 hours of waiting we contacted the counter and they informed us that we would reschedule the tickets for 11, because the flight would not arrive in time for the FLL - UIO connection. It did not matter that family meetings planned months before had to cancel. Jetblue argued that they could not do more and that they did not have flights available to accommodate us before that date.THREE DAYS LATER, we returned to the ATL airport and this time we got the tickets and complete tags, checked and delivered 2 pieces of luggage. While we were passing TSA and approaching the boarding gate, Jetblue decided to prioritize waiting passengers and had our 5 seats and a sixth passenger to UIO, leaving us again off the flight, suggesting again reschedule our tickets for 13. An agent named Michael approached to explain that Jetblue could dispose of the seats at his discretion. As a special concession, we would keep our checked baggage, already on the plane, and deliver it to UIO, when our itinerary would finally be fulfilled. Recommends that we call Jetblue by phone if we want to extend our stay. When calling, an agent tells us that it will cost US $250 each to modify the return date by Jetblue policies.After FIVE DAYS LOST FAMILY HOLIDAYS, we returned to the airport and made the process again. Being in line to check, the airport manager for Jetblue informed us that with the electronic tickets we could advance to the boarding gate. Upon arrival with TSA, they indicated that the electronic tickets were not valid to fly that day, which appeared as usable the previous day. We return with the Jetblue agents and ask them to review, they tell us that the flight was assigned for the 12th, due to confusion, and they assigned it for the 13th at that moment.With the printed tickets we go to the boarding gate, where we are witnesses that the staff asks for volunteers to travel later because this time they also have overbooked tickets. We fly to FLL. Upon arrival we approach the customer service desk at terminal E to find out about our bags, there are 3 employees of Jetblue talking about who will take the turn of Friday night, because they would like to attend a party, while 8 clients wait. 2 of them are: Justin and Janelle **. When I ask him to do his job and I want to know where my bags are, he tells me that I have to go to the warehouse and find it to take to baggage delivery, because it is my responsibility to have lost the flights. When explaining the responsibility of Jetblue in all the delays, he agrees to call, he tells me that unfortunately there is no one who attends the warehouse and that he will continue to insist, and recommended to advance to the exit door to UIO, because Jetblue could take the decision to take off without us. I take the advice and go to building F. There, I go back to the customer service desk and request my luggage information again, the agent surnamed ** tells me to look for it, 20 minutes later, she confirms that my luggage is located and will be sent on the flight we are traveling.When arriving in Quito, the luggage did not arrive. A Jetblue agent approached us and offered his help, explaining the situation, he started looking for luggage at ATL, FLL, UIO until he finally informed us that he was on the next flight and that he would help us recover it.\u200b When arriving in Quito, the luggage did not arrive. A Jetblue agent approached us and offered his help, explaining the situation, he started looking for luggage at ATL, FLL, UIO until he finally informed us that he was on the next flight and that he would help us recover it. 1 hour after waiting for an answer, but with someone looking for it, we receive news. Thanks to this employee, a mole in Jetblue, at least we received our luggage, late but we got it. Great work by Carlos **.As a result, our planned vacation for months, including family and religious ceremonies, was ruined by the dismal performance of Jetblue employees, FIVE lost days, waste of time, fuel (2.5 hours of travel between Chelsea AL and Atlanta GA and vice versa, 4 trips with a total of 10 hours), and emotional wear and tear are the result of our first flight with Jetblue. I need to know what actions the company intends to take in the face of this poor performance and what remedial actions it will have for us.

This was our first vacation for my fiance and I with our two children age 21 and 14. We had 14 other family members going with us also. Had our flights checked in online the day before. We arrived with our AWAY luggage and had it checked in with no problems. We then all went through security with no problems, and went to sit at the area where our gate was. 30 minutes prior to the doors closing they called our names stating there was a problem with our luggage. They had the batteries in the baggage in which we were not aware it could not be there. We purchased the away luggage because one of the biggest selling points were the chargeable batteries. This being our first flight we did not know they could not be installed in the bags where they belong. Later on one of the workers there told me they wish they would stop selling the AWAY bags as this has become a problem. Knowing that they should put up some type of signage stating if you have luggage equipped with batteries, they must be removed. They told us to hurry and sent us to a location where they stated our luggage would be there to pop out the batteries and make it back before they take off. They sent us to the wrong location stating our luggage would be there. That department sent us to the right location and our luggage was not there to remove the batteries. We waited so long for them to get the bags, moved so slow they could care less that this trip cost us $9,000 total including straight flight from Boston to Punta Cana and back, all inclusive resort for 7 days and a van to and from the resort. Finally they retrieved our bags. We took the batteries out. They had us place our 4 bags again at the baggage area and go to security. If they would have put us through the security quicker stating we had already been there we would have made the flight. Instead they stated we had to wait in line. I received a call from the flight attendant stating they were closing the doors and we would not make the flight and if I would give permission for my 14 year old child to travel with our older family members putting them in charge of her as she was a minor. I consented as they were on the plane already and thankfully I had my family members there I trust with all my heart. They made us miss our flight, separated us from our kids who were now on the flight with our family. I paid extra money for a straight flight. They took us out of the security line went to retrieve our bags again so they would not be on that plane and had us rebook two tickets, one for me and my fiance. The only ones they had available were to leave at 1:30 to JFK and then after 1.5 hours to Punta Cana. We retrieved the tickets again. Checked in our bags and went through security. The flight attendants were very nice and explained everything on the plane where things were if needed. Instead of arriving at 12 noon in Punta Cana We arrived at 6PM after customs and everything we had to go through and the drive we arrived at 8:30 PM that night. My daughters were so happy to see us and I later found out the youngest one had cried. She was afraid something would happen to us. There was no urgency on their part of taking care of passengers who paid so much money for a flight, no care or compassion for what occurred. Not even an apology. I will be posting this on multiple other sites as I do not want this happening to anyone else and feel this is unfair. We all work hard for our money in order to be able to take a vacation. I missed a whole day of mine because they couldn't just take an extra step to help us. I'm very disappointed in Jetblue.

This is your statement which was commendable and a welcoming statement in an industry that is demanding and stressed with FAA regulations, TSA regulations and the consumers. Air travel should be a comfortable and joyful experience. On May 29, 2016, I boarded Flight 1589 at Gate D15, assigned Seat 7C. Upon boarding I walked to my assigned seat and found an older couple who were above average in weight. I am 6'1\" and weigh 260 pounds. I am not obese, I'm a large-framed man who is very athletic. I was involved with the NFL in the early 70's.Flight 1589 was possibly at 50% capacity. Rather than inconvenience the older couple, I stated to the couple to stay put and I will sit two (2) rows back in empty seats. At that moment the flight attendant (Kathy) who must have had a very bad morning was extremely obnoxious and somewhat upset at someone from the onset. As we boarded the aircraft at 7:00 a.m., she was not barely and able to place a smile on her face to greet the passengers as we boarded. Kathy stated the seat I was sitting in required an upgrade. I did not want to pay the upgrade. Kathy offered me to sit in the back of the aircraft or take my assigned seat. The back rows were empty.The confusion?? A flight attendant began giving me instructions. Not understanding what she wanted, I merely took my assigned seat (7C), and apologizing to the flight attendants and to the couple who was sitting in row 7. Shortly thereafter a supervisor, Chantel arrived and asked to talk with me in the Jetway. She instructed me that I am a security safety risk to the aircraft. During our conversation with the supervisor, Kathy placed my carry-on luggage in the Jetway. Totally confused, I asked what is the issue. Again Chantel stated I was a risk to this aircraft and other passengers.Totally confused without discussion, Chantel stated we are placing you on the next flight to Boston and then to Fort Lauderdale. I tried to explain to Chantel and the flight attendants I have an engagement to attend at 5:00 P.M. that day, to arrive to Fort Lauderdale at 4:00 P.M. would be tiring and not amenable to my schedule. Again the Flight Attendants stated \"you did not follow our instructions\". Obviously with no other options, without further discussion or understanding, I was forced to take the connecting flight from Boston to Fort Lauderdale. Be mindful I was told I am a security risk, yet I was placed on the next JetBlue flight to Boston then to Fort Lauderdale. I was not able to attend my niece's engagement.Conclusion: the flight attendants should have a procedure to follow before removing a passenger or passengers from a flight. Alcoholics who are disruptive is a zero tolerance. Drug addicted passengers who are disruptive is a zero tolerance. Thereafter for customer relationships and customer satisfaction, without compromising other passengers and delay to push the aircraft from the gate, the attendants must be able to communicate with passengers and bring forward a peaceful resolution before removing passengers from an aircraft.I know all to well flight procedures. In this instance I was confronted with two (2) flight attendants who were not happy to be on this flight nor did they appreciate they have a job nor do they appreciate the importance that JetBlue have a friendly customer relationship base. I am 69 years old, in excellent health. I am a true-blue customer who often flies to Fort Lauderdale for business. I am a pilot with over 2700 hours of flight time. See attached. I have never experienced such demeanor and humiliation by flight attendants. I have volunteered and taken children for short airplane rides to promote \"flight\". The airlines should always be a fun-filled experience.Based on recent news coverage which I have recently discovered of passengers being removed from JetBlue flights, it is appalling that flight attendants are not given instructions to utilize their discretion when dealing with very minor issues such as a simple seat assignment on an aircraft that is at 50% capacity.

I had another flight on September 2015 (round trip). When I was going to buy another ticket in May 2016 I had 0 points. Like if I never had any trips. Before this in January 2015 I realized that my points were not added to my ticket fare. I called them and the operator said that the tickets will be added once I travel there. I traveled then in September always putting my email address when I was asked for my Trueblue email address. Once I entered it the True blue number assigned since the very beginning appeared in my reservation: ** (as always it says Trueblue member **).Now that I called to ask why I do not receive any points yet, they told me that the number does not exist anymore and that is under another person's name. I told them that I don't assign the number I put my email and the number is always assigned by their system. Their answer was to create another account to transfer my points worth only from 12 months ago (meaning I lost the points of my first purchase January 2015). I said is not fair because they STATE in their page that the points do not expire and I should have points from the very first trip to the last one. It is not my fault that their system gave me a wrong number. After trying to reason with operators and Managers whom I called 3 times, I tried to create another account so that I assigned the 12 month points and it marked an error. I could not use my email to create another account to transfer my points. I lately tried to create a new email and to claim at least the points I should have since September 2015, and still have error messages.

I have not receive any emails from them, neither an update information on this case. They just limited to say that they will look for the problem and that it could take months to solve it.

The flight we had on Dec 5th was worst experience we have ever had on any airlines. Problem my wife and I were in seats 16D & a6E, my wife was also in a cast for a broken foot. Right before takeoff a OVERLY EXTREMELY LARGE individual Sat in 16F. As he forced his way into the seat he lifted the armrest. At that point I told my wife to put the armrest down which was impossible since it was basically in the middle of his back (I would not exaggerate this). We tried to be polite and left our armrest up so my wife could sit halfway in my seat. This was not feasible since she had her leg in cast due to a broken foot and asked for attendant assistance. Was treated badly for asking for another seat and was told their company policy treated oversize people as disabled/handicapped, and if I wanted another seat I would have to pay.I said no and told them that the armrest should be put down because we paid for a seat between the 2 armrests. They told us to wake the individual and deal with him. I told them that was their job. Bottom line my wife and I were put at the forefront of JetBlue's company policy toward obese people. If the company feels the people are disabled or handicapped, they should make accommodations for them at their expense not mine. If this has happened to you and you feel you were discriminated against by JetBlue, please reach out for a possible class action lawsuit to force them to reimburse customers such as myself, and to pay and accommodate for these people themselves.", "num_found_useful": "16"}, {"ratings": "1.0", "reviewer_location": " MA", "review_time_utc": "1420088400.0", "review_description": "Will never fly with this ** airlines again!

They would not give him his luggage nor provide any definitive answers. At 2:30 am, he was told the flight was cancelled and they were all booked for the next day. They left him stranded at the airport, providing no ground transportation to Boston or even back to Philly. They provided no hotel and left him there with no way of getting him to his intended destination. I had to drive 3 hours to pick him up in the middle of the night. I had to use extra gas and tolls to pick up my son because Jetblue would not help him in any way. I also had to pay additional money to book a train the next day because Jetblue had no flights to accommodate him. I called Jetblue and spoke to a very rude supervisor, Tracy #**, who would not refund my money, was very unsympathetic on the phone. She told me that his ticket was used even though the plane was diverted and they would not give me a full refund or credit. I purchased a ticket for my son to go from Philadelphia to Boston. They did not provide this service and take him to the intended destination. They left him for 14 hours with no answers or accommodations. I will never fly Jetblue again and intend to write the CEO to let him know of the robbery that his airline provides. I want to hear from a Jetblue representative and I want this matter rectified. It appears they do not care about their clients or if the person reaches their intended city. Their customer service is horrific and I was never met with such rudeness.

I called to change my flight on the evening of February 2nd at 9 pm due to the inclement weather the past couple of days as well as a storm predicted this upcoming weekend. I needed to change my flight as I could not risk not making it back on Sunday evening. First it took over an hour to get a \"customer service\" representative on the phone and after speaking to them for 5 minutes and informing them of the change in flight, she informed me that there was a $100 change fee with the ticket. The representative told me might be able to get the fee waived however she needed to speak to her supervisor and there was a 30 min wait time for her to speak to her supervisor. I waited patiently and finally after about 45 minutes she came back on the line to inform me that they could waive the fee however at this time the call got disconnected from their end. Very frustrated I called them back and had to wait an hour again to speak to anyone. I asked the representative if she could take my number down in case they drop my call again, however that is not an option as they cannot contact me back even if they lose a call. Once again they had to go through the same process again of trying to contact their supervisor to get the fee waived as they had no record of my previous call however this time the supervisor who the representative spoke to refused to waive the $100 per person fee and informed me that it was up to each supervisors discretion as to if they will waive the fee or not. Extremely livid as I had wasted 4 hours and it was 1 am at this point. I spoke to the supervisor directly and informed them of the whole situation and after another 20 minutes the only resolution she could come up with was that she would try to find who I spoke to the first time and give me a call back today. I have yet to receive any call. I typically have always flown with United and their customer service is always great and changing flights is very seamless.

I was somewhat optimistic about possibly still catching my flight since I noticed that the TSA checkpoint was unusually empty. I walk up to the counter where a gentleman named Harry, who seemed to me was in a particularly fool mood greeted me. I informed him that I was aware that I am arriving well past the recommended check in time & asked what options did I have a this point.Honestly he seemed more interested in verbally chastising me for my tardiness than actually accommodating me. I asked if there was any way I could run to the gate, an option that has been afforded to me in the past by other airlines, and have my bag placed on another flight to the same destination. He informed me that my ONLY option was to pay the $50 rebooking fee for the next available flight which was the following day. I agreed & while he was making arrangements to do so it occurred to me to ask if flying standby on the next flight was an option. He said \"that's one way you could go\" in a rather sarcastic tone at which point I asked why was this not presented to me as an option from the start.At this point Harry became defensive towards me & stated that I was accusing him of doing something unethical. Realizing that I had gone as far as possible with Harry I asked to speak to a supervisor. Harry reluctantly called over what I have to assume was a supervisor, since he did not present or identify himself as such, named Marshal. Marshal seemed less than interested in hearing what I had to say instead making excuses for Harry without even having consulted either one of us to gather the pertinent information regarding our issue. At one point Marshal said to me that \"Harry most likely did not offer standby cause he checked the manifest for that flight & it was full.\" I asked if he knew that as a fact & how would he know when I knew that Marshal had not taken the time to have either Harry or myself brief him on the current situation. Marshal's response to this was raising his voice while grabbing his walkie talkie & telling me I needed to calm down. I informed him that I was being very calm to which he replied \"no, you're being aggressive.\" I repeated that I was being extremely calm given the circumstances to which he replied \"Oh... and what's that supposed to mean?\" Realizing that he was obviously trying to goad me into saying something threatening to him which is tantamount to yelling out \"bomb\" at the airport these days I said \"I'm not dumb, I know what you're trying to do. I'm not going to do or say something foolish in an airport.\" He then told me \"I wish you would\" & \"I get off at 7:30 pm if you want to handle it another way.\" To which I replied \"I wish I could\"... right away. He smiled & said \"oh you just threatened me!\" & Harry chimed in \"yes he did, call the police.\" I guess I was supposed to panic & run out of the airport leaving everything behind but knowing my rights & the fact I did nothing wrong I smiled & waited for the police. After about 5 min the Fort Lauderdale airport police deemed I wasn't a threat & I was left in the capable hands of yet another supervisor for JetBlue. She must've been trained by the same people that gave Harry & Marshal their training because she pretty much picked up where they left off. At no point was Marshal held accountable for the way he spoke to a customer, instead she was more interested in determining if I was suitable to be placed on another JetBlue flight without incident! I kindly informed her that a police officer, who in my opinion is more qualified to make that assessment, thought so. I also asked her if she cared about the way her ticket agents had behaved towards me. It was like talking to a wall wearing a bad wig. At this point I realized no one was going to afford me any kindness much less customer service so I requested a refund. She said a credit would be issued but no refunds as it is not in their policy. I said this was unacceptable to me for I refuse to give JetBlue any business as long as they endorse this type of behavior towards customers. She said a couple of things under her breath to Harry & reluctantly called corporate arrange my refund. I thanked her & asked for her name as well as the last names of Harry & Marshal so that I may write a letter about my experience, she laughed & told me they do not have last names & that she did not feel comfortable giving me hers. I have never witnessed such a lack of courtesy or professionalism in all my years of travel.

But this past summer, he was hesitant to board our flight from Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen. I am scared, he said, the airplane is going to fall in the water. After some coaxing, we made it onboard. He was tense but we distracted him with his favorite games. Once airborne, the episode was quickly over, and the remaining 7 hours passed without incident. The next five flights were incident-free. And then there was Jetblue flight 875 on November 15 from Fort Lauderdale to Kingston.He was enthusiastic as we prepared, and with his cooperation we checked our bags, cleared security, and arrived at our gate with over an hour to spare. Priority access is accorded to children under 2, and our group was the last to be called for boarding. Then without warning, the old fear resurfaced. We made it as far as the door of the aircraft when we were met by the disapproving cabin crew who blocked our entry. Not while he is hysterical, we were told. I appealed to be allowed to stow our personal effects so I could calm him. \"We can't allow you onboard while he's hysterical.\" We were brushed aside and the door of the aircraft was shut in our faces, with our bags onboard.The aircraft won't wait. \"You can claim your bags in Jamaica. We'll try to accommodate you on a flight at 6 a.m. tomorrow. But only if he's quiet.\" To return at the crack of dawn for another Jetblue flight that might take us or not at their discretion; or receive a Jetblue flight credit for travel within the next two years (hopefully my child would have outgrown this fear by age 6)? One hour and a harried taxi ride to Miami International Airport later, we managed to purchase a new ticket out of pocket, cleared security, and were boarded on an American Airlines flight. Did he cry? Absolutely!The American Airlines solution was to assist me with depositing my personal belongings, seat us at the rear of the aircraft, and allow me the time and free hands to calm my child. Their risk assessment seemed to identify a screaming 4-year-old for what he is: a scared child, not a threat or inconvenience. After takeoff, he was back to being a normal child again. Then at the end of our hour-and-a-half journey, of his own accord, he visited the crew. \"Sorry for screaming, he said to one and all.\" The price of being reunited with my bags: $900. The price of getting Jetblue to refund the ticket they refused to honor: one year knocked off my life expectancy.It's a non-refundable ticket, the customer service agent explained, blatantly disregarding the fact that they refused to transport us although we had fulfilled our side of the contract. After a thirty-minute international call (who needs toll free numbers for their customer's convenience? Not Jetblue! ), common sense finally prevailed. A refund will be issued in 7-10 business days. Followed swiftly by a descent into the nonsensical again. The refusal to carry him was based on safety concerns. Because there is, of course, a precedence of a hysterical 4-year-old bringing down a commercial aircraft. But baggage being transported without accompanying passengers? Nope. No such precedence.Ever heard those final boarding calls warning late passengers that their baggage will be removed from the aircraft? I always thought there was a reason for that you know, the same reason why terminals are shut down when a bag is left unattended. It seems in Jetblue's thesaurus, comfort, convenience, and scheduling are synonyms for safety. To Jetblue's bemusement, I refuse to use their services to return home. Personally, I never thought it was a good idea to get back into the car with the abusive driver, because, you know, Fool me once and all that jazz.

Being that our flight was delayed, because JetBlue was unable to located our flight's First Officer, our flight landed after 11pm. I was given an alternative phone number to contact someone at the airport which only gave me a recording saying no one was available. I left a message with my contact information and did not hear anything back. The representative I was on the phone with from JetBlue said the only option I had was to load my newly ruined items back into our newly ruined suitcase and drive it another 2 hours back to the airport and hope that there might be someone available to help me. When I asked the representative \"What if no one is available? Is this my only option\", her response was \"Yes sorry, hope your night gets better\".", "num_found_useful": "6"}, {"ratings": "1.0", "reviewer_location": " NJ", "review_time_utc": "1388552400.0", "review_description": "I'm extremely disappointed in my experience with JETBLUE.

We had never flown with Jetblue before but had heard good things. Realistically, we expected nothing. It's an airline, as long as it took off and landed we don't care.After waiting on the plane for 1 hour, everyone was bused back to the terminal where we had to wait for three hours. No one would tell us what was going or offer us meal credits. Finally, we boarded at 3:30 knowing there was no way we would make our connecting flight. The pilot then announced that there had been a problem with the toilets not flushing. Everyone was angry because we could have held it for the 3 1/2 hour flight. The pilot said that because it made a light flash in the cockpit, he refused to fly. Fine, whatever. We were told that everything would be sorted once we landed in JFK.By the time we arrived in JFK, 70% of the passengers had missed their connecting flight. We were immediately told by a JetBlue rep that there were no more flights tonight and that we would all be put in hotels. We all had to find our own way to terminal 5 (the JetBlue's terminal) where we were all told that we would not be put up in hotels. That all hotels were booked and that we could spend $150 of our own money (we would be reimbursed apparently) if we could find a hotel. There is no way at the last minute, at JFK you can find a hotel for $150. I spent over an hour trying. Plus there would be no compensation for $70 cab fair to said hotels. At this point my husband became angry and said they need to do something. The man serving us got very pissed and refused to help us. Refused to help anyone, he went off at us because apparently it's not his problem. Sorry buddy, you\u2019re a Jetblue representative. It is your problem. Finally we spoke to a supervisor. She was no better, really and truly couldn't have care less. I asked her what we were all supposed to do. She shrugged and said, \"It's not my problem.\"We had to beg for meal credits. We begged! We hadn't eaten since the morning. All we got was $24 to cover dinner and breakfast for 2 people ... in an airport terminal. Yeah right!!! Most of the other passengers didn't even get meal credits. Because it was now 11:30 at night the terminal was closed. I had never seen anything like it before. Elderly couples, families with small children, honeymooners try to sleep on a freezing cold floor. One couple had gone on vacation before the wife was starting cancer treatment, talk about ruining a much need vacation.My husband called up JetBlue and the rep he spoke to was appalled at the way we were being treated and claimed this was not their policy. He then upgraded us to even more space seats and offered us more meal credits (only another $16 though) and put us on the next available flight. That flight left at 9.00 the next morning was a 6 hour flight to Long Beach, CA. There we would have to wait 4 hours for a connecting flight to SLC. At this point we just wanted to get home and were grateful for being upgraded so that we could at least try and sleep. No one else got any of this because they didn't call and complain.The airline attendant on our flight to Long Beach was the nicest JetBlue rep we came in contact. I was shacking and shivering while waiting for the bathroom (I do that when I only get an hour\u2019s sleep) at which point he asked if I was ok. I explained everything that had happened and he gave us a free blanket (they normally cost $15 - it was a really crappy blanket) along with extra food.But our connecting flight to SLC was something else though. It was announced that the flight would be delayed 40 minutes because of fog in SLC. There was no fog in Salt Lake, we checked. When we finally boarded, the pilot said it was because of air force when flying from San Francisco. So wait, which was it? Fog on the flight from SLC or air force interference flying from San Francisco? The pilot also thought he was flying Delta and JetBlue. That was pretty funny.There was an elderly couple sat behind us who had been through all this and they hadn't been upgraded. The flight was empty and there were lots of 'even more space\" seats available. The elderly women asked if they could move and the flight attendant said, \"No, there was a charge for those seats.\" The old man muttered, \"This is ** ridiculous\" to which flight attendant name Kasey said, \"What did you just say to me?\" The gentlemen replied that he hadn't said anything to her. \"Yes you did, don't swear at me! I will have you escorted off this flight. Is that what you want?\" She then got the supervisor named Jerome who came and said, \"This is my flight and it's gonna go my way.\" I don't know what they teach their Jetblue representatives but they were so viscious and self centered, everything was an affront to their personal rights. I wouldn't want to be on one of the flights if there was a problem, they seemed like they would use the passengers as flotation devices. My husband stepped in at this point and told Jerome he needed to calm down and tried to explain what we had all gone through. He said, \"I don't care, I was delayed too.\" To which I responded, \"You weren't delayed 17 hours and made to sleep on terminal floor.\" He completely disregarded us and said, \"That didn't happen!\" Then walked off.I don't know how the gentlemen behind us did it but later in the flight he apologized to Kasey, she lapped it all up and said, \"If you had told me your situation nicely, I would have upgraded you.\" We were only halfway there, seats were still available, she didn't move them. All in all we were delayed 17 hours due to mechanical issues, we were treated like cattle (actually cattle are treated better) and all we got offered is $100 towards another JetBlue flight within the year.We have flown 27 times in the last 8 years with many different airlines and have never been treated this way. I can understand this treatment if it had been a weather delay, but this was a mechanical issue and a stupid one at that. I will never fly with Jetblue again. I will tell everyone and post this same review on every site on the internet. I don't know who Jetblue bribes to be classed as the best airline but it can go on forever.", "num_found_useful": "24"}, {"ratings": "1.0", "reviewer_location": " FL", "review_time_utc": "1388552400.0", "review_description": "Checked in at JFK on 10/14/2014 for a flight to West Palm Beach airport.

I guess that they were upset that I walked up to the counter while they were having a conversation. I had to ask for a supervisor who then checked me in half-heartedly.

That is the answer for them. I do not think I have ever been treated so bad by an airline or any company. I use to own my own business and I would have been out of business if I treated clients like they do. I went to my daughter's wedding. I flew JetBlue both ways. I transferred in Puerto Rico. On the trip down it was so easy. First off - my luggage which was brand new came out totally open. I am not even making a complaint on that issue. Many years ago, I had three neck surgeries when an eight wheeler truck rear ended my car. I am left with nerve damage and the lack of total use of my arm. I wear pain patches when it gets bad. On the flight when I arrived in Puerto Rico from St. Marten - the stewardess said that the passengers have to pick up the luggage. She failed to inform people that it was going to be a five block walk outside of one terminal to another and that if anyone has a problem this might be the time for wheelchair. I leave the plane and the elevator is LOCKED. I had to wait quite a while and worrying that the next flight is scheduled to leave and to find someone to open the elevator. I picked up the luggage. I had to wheel it over broken cement for about five blocks and into a big crowd. A JetBlue Employee tells me that I have to go to Agriculture and come back to her. Another lift of the luggage. Of course, the JetBlue employee was not there. So I had to cut into line. Then we had to go thru customs - which was a total mess. This all could have been prevented. First off -- an airlines of that size should have disability areas open and available - like the elevator. I get on the Flight to go to Ft. Lauderdale. I asked for a wheelchair when we arrive. I was in so much pain. This is the clincher - they have a wheelchair for me. I tipped the guy. He picks up my luggage and gets a call from JetBlue - so JetBlue dumped me on a bench and left me. JetBlue claims I should have made a 24 hour reservation for the wheelchair - so that gives them the right to dump me on a bench in FLL. Finally - an airplane employee comes up to me. She saw what happened. She informed me that I had another two block walk to get a cab. I - once again - had to drag luggage to the cab. I feel it is JetBlue's responsibility to have put me in a cab.I have been having medical massages and have been using patches. They offer me $50.00. I said - no that I wanted a flight to New York or that they pay for my expenses. I am now putting in a dispute with American Express. JetBlue writes back that you have to have 24 hour notice to get a wheelchair. After what they put me through - I do not deserve this. I do not like confrontation and just wanted to settle this. It is now a nightmare. They have said they tried to call me. Another lie. I offered my phone for them to check. There are no missed calls or voice mail messages. How would I ever trust that airlines flying me anywhere. I flew on JetBlue to St. Marten on August 10th from Ft. Lauderdale. I flew back on August 13th. Does anyone know where I can report them?? They also said they were going to call Puerto Rico. What is that going to do? That airport is a disaster. To treat a disabled person with such abuse - really upsets me.", "num_found_useful": "14"}, {"ratings": "1.0", "reviewer_location": " NY", "review_time_utc": "1388552400.0", "review_description": "Jet Blue changes our flight. My wife and I were to travel to Fla for a wedding. We were flying there and back same day. Jet Blue changed the flight time several times. The last time making it very difficult to attend the wedding. We had to cancel the flight. We were not only charged 40 percent of the airfare but the balance was held for a future trip. They can change the flight and charge us? As I see it we apparently cannot cancel the flight we can only change to another trip. If that is the case we in effect are not cancelling our ticket. I find it unacceptable and very poor business that they believe it's okay to both charge a forty percent cancellation fee and keep the balance forcing you to pay again to fly. This practice needs to be addressed and made public. I see no advantage in paying months in advance for a ticket and am sure many others will agree.", "num_found_useful": "15"}
